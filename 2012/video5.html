<h4>Hispanic-Market Broadcast: "Positivity"</h4>
<p>Branding spots featuring El Maestro maintained awareness of milk and its positive attributes while overlays throughout the year extended the message. In partnership with Radio Disney, Southern California had its very first Walkathon Positivo, aimed at educating Hispanic families on the benefits of drinking milk in order to be more positive and to recover after exercising. For Back to School, the message supported the idea that the best day starts the night before, with a good nightâ€™s sleep. This partnered the old broadcast tradition of reminding kids to go to bed with the timeless tradition of a bedtime story and a glass of milk.</p>
